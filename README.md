### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Driven by curiosity and a love for new challenges, I find my motivation in constant learning. Self-taught and trustworthy in everything I do.
A passionate tester, I'm currently expanding my skillset with three.js alongside my digital project management studies.

My expertise includes:
- Interface design (Figma)
- Front-end development (Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Sanity)
- Web3 onboarding / Smart contracts (Solidity, Viem, Wagmi)
